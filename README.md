# Practice_Dataset_Binary_Classification
## Machine Learning basics and preprocessing
 First project with machine learning in python
 
 This project was created by:
- [Wojciech Michaluk](https://github.com/wojo501)
- Michai≈Ç Legczylin

It was first project of university ML corse. <br/><br/>
The main goal of this project was to learn the basics about preprocessing and building models. We had artigicially made [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextbigwhat/dataset-1) from Kaggle. <br/><br/>

# About the project
1) First we checked datatypes in dataset. 
2) We detected constant and quasi-constant features. 
3) Handled outliers with Z-score.
4) Standarized data.
5) Built models.
6) Boosted models by choosing proper hyper-parameters.

Plotting columns standard deviations.
